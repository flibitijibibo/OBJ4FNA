About OBJ4FNA
-------------
OBJ4FNA was written for a currently unannounced project by Ethan Lee. The artist
exports models from Blender, generating OBJ files for geometry and PNG files for
the models' UV materials.

This is not meant to be a comprehensive OBJ parser; it is mostly meant for
static models with no animations.

Notes for Artists
-----------------
When exporting to OBJ, be sure to select "Triangulated Mesh"! OBJ4FNA only
supports triangle meshes, so quads and other polygon types will not work.

Dependencies
------------
OBJ4FNA depends on FNA's SetDataPointerEXT extension. The example code also
depends on FNA's IsRelativeMouseModeEXT extension.
